    <h1 id="Test">Quick hummus recipe</h1>

  <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
  <li> A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
  <li> 1 clove of garlic</li>
  <li> A dash of olive oil</li>
</ul>
    <h2 >Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
  <li>  Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
  <ul>
      <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>  If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
</ol>
    <p>For a different <a title="{Хабр}" href="https://habr.com/top/">flavour, you</a> could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <h3>Storage</h3>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

    <p><i>Hummus</i> is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
    <p>I am <em>glad</em> you weren't <em>late</em>.</p>
    <h1>Important notice</h1>

    <p>On Sunday January <a href="#Test"<b>9th 2010</b></a>, a gang of goths were
    spotted <strong>stealing</strong> several garden gnomes from a shopping
    center in downtown <i>Milwaukee</i>. <em>They</em> were all <span>wearing green</span>
    jumpsuits and silly hats, and seemed to be having a whale
    of a time. If anyone has any information about this
